I am a second semester bachelor's student studying data science and AI at Saarland University, Germany. Besides my studies, I work as a research assistant at the Interdisciplinary Institute for Societal Computing working on a project about electoral advice given by large language models and how to assure alignment with this to the users ideology. 

I am passionate about AI safety, both in the technical and governace aspect, and believe that it is one of the most pressing issues at this time.
